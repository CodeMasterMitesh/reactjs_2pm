In React.js, state is a built-in object (in class components) or a variable managed by the useState Hook (in functional components) that is used to store and manage data that changes over time within a component. 
When the state changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the updated information in the user interface (UI). 


Key Characteristics
Component's Memory: State allows a component to "remember" user interactions or application events, such as form input values, UI toggles (e.g., dropdown open/closed), or fetched data from a server.
Dynamic and Interactive: It is what makes React components dynamic and responsive. Without state, components would only render static content.
Mutable (but updated via specific methods): Unlike props, which are read-only, state is mutable, meaning it can be changed within the component. However, you should never modify the state directly (e.g., this.state.count = 5); instead, you must use the provided state-setting functions (setState() in class components or setCount() from the useState hook in functional components).
Local and Encapsulated: State is generally local and private to the specific component instance that declares it. A parent component cannot directly access or change the state of its child components. To coordinate state between components, it often needs to be "lifted up" to a common parent.
Triggers Re-renders: The primary feature of state is that calling its updater function queues a re-render of the component with the new data, ensuring the UI stays in sync with the data



useState is a built-in React Hook that allows you to add state variables to functional components. State is a special type of memory for a component that React "watches," so when the state value changes, the component automatically re-renders to reflect the new data in the UI. 
Key Concepts
Purpose: useState enables dynamic and interactive user interfaces by allowing functional components to remember information (like form input, a counter value, or a toggle status) across renders.
Syntax: You import useState from the react library and use array destructuring to access the state variable and its updater function.
